| Security and Leadership          | Alan Jenkins | Alan has mentioned a trade-off in risks between business and academic, and he has emphasized the role of security in the business. In business, communication is vital, I think this is part of leadership, and we need to pay attention to others reacting. I agree with his views on careers that he believes that academic performance is not everything. Passion and interest are equally important. | Q1:How do you pull rank in civilian life?<br />A1:There is no rank. There is no rank, and people should communicate in the commercial world, a 2-way process, rather than use authority, and it is less hierarchical.<br />Q2:My mother often complains that to progress financially, and she'd have to become a manager and not use her Tech skill and do you think this situation is improving?<br />A2:Yes, I think it is improving in several ways but still have ways to go. | Yes        |
| Supplier Governance              | Sarah Clarke | Sarah gave us a very rich lecture, including how to define risks and introduced us supply chain complexity and so on and finally proposed some better methods. I really learned a lot. What interested me most is the KRIs part, I have an understanding of how to assess the suppliers. It can be seen that the speaker really prepared a lot. | Q1:What measures are the best to take to ensure that staff or former staff do not branch company and client/ customer data?<br /> A1:People tend to fall into two parts: his awareness and training worth it, or is it pointless. Moreover, you need to look down the technology to stop people from doing something stupid. There is much better and growing quality of contextual training. | Yes        |
| 'Hacking' demos Pentest Partners | Tony Gee     | Great lecture, and to be honest, I think it's more interesting than the last one. Tony emphasized the importance of information and gave a few examples, and what impressed me the most was the example of stealing user's wifi password through wifi kettle, and this let me know that I should protect my privacy. Tony also showed me how to hack a fake company. Really love this lecture, thank you, Tony. | Q1ï¼šHow can we protect against an IOS device that we own if it's got a security flaw? <br />A1:What people can do if they identify the vulnerabilities, and they need to tell the manufacturers so that the manufacturers can go ahead and update it. People can also do some simple things like putting these devices on to the guests' wireless networks or more advanced network. | Yes        |
